                ChooChoo is a social experiment and NFT game built on Base! It&apos;s a unique train
                that travels from wallet to wallet across the Farcaster community. When ChooChoo
                visits your wallet, you become the current passenger and get to help decide where it
                goes next. Each previous passenger receives a special journey ticket NFT as proof of
                their ride.

                chance, after 30 minutes, anyone can select a random winner from the replies to your
                cast to ride next. A winner is randomly selected from the replies, they receive
                ChooChoo, and you get a unique ticket NFT as a souvenir of your trip!
